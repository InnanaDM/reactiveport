    <h2>
      <div id="line1"> Hello! My name is Alan Elam. I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia. My fondest memory is after
        school every day I would jump on my beach cruiser, put surf board on my board rack and ride down to the beach to
        my favorite spot. My plan is to get back to the beach life.
        <br>
        <br>
        The reason I started this program is to change the career path I was on. I have been working in a career that I
        told myself that I would never do for the rest of my life. It was so I could fix anything in my future house. It
        was so I wouldnt have to call a contractor out to fix something I was perfectly capable of doing myself. Now I
        have learned everything there is to learn in this field. So naturely it is time to move on and learn something
        that I can see myself doing until I retire. Or use to start my own business if thats where it takes me.
